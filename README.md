#Towards A Real-World Road Damage Detection Dataset

We have currently released the val(mini) dataset(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_JCFbFF8S0HqxVj0_72R6Kmbe_t4teQ/view?usp=drive_link). 

Since the dataset still contains personal privacy information, such as faces and license plates, further processing is required. The complete dataset will be made available as soon as the privacy concerns are addressed.
